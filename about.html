<p>Keeping you safe has always been Volvo’s mission. And the humble<br> safety belt has helped us save an estimated one million lives since<br> Volvo’s Nils Bohlin introduced the three-point safety belt back in<br> 1959. Since then, we’ve been on a constant path of innovation – right<br> up to<br> creating the world’s first seat belts that pre-tighten when the car<br> senses that a rear impact is imminent.</p></p>
